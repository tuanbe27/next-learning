**The Hollow Knight** is the Vessel chosen by the Pale King to seal away the
Radiance and save Hallownest from the Infection. Like their siblings, they are
the child of the King and Queen of Hallownest, birthed in the Abyss to be
infused with the power of the Void. As such, they are genderless. This birth
condition was also supposed to leave them without a mind, will, and voice, to
prevent the Radiance from influencing them. However, their purity was misjudged,
tarnished by an idea instilled, a bond with the Pale King who raised them.

Regardless of their impurity, the Hollow Knight was trained and raised,
eventually becoming a fully grown Vessel. The Radiance was sealed within them,
and they were chained within the Temple of the Black Egg where they were
expected to contain the Infection for eternity. However, because of the
aforementioned impurities, the Radiance could still exert influence. It
ultimately resulted in the resurgence of the Infection and the Kingdom falling
into ruin.
